A `lightning-badge` is a label that holds small amounts of information. A
badge can be used to display unread notifications, or to label a block of
text. Badges don't work for navigation because they can't include a hyperlink.

This component inherits styling from
[badges](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/badges/) in the
Lightning Design System.

Here is an example.

```html
<template>
     <lightning-badge label="Label">
     </lightning-badge>
</template>
```
