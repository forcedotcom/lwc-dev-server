A `lightning-breadcrumbs` component is an ordered list that displays the path
of a page and helps you navigate back to the parent. Each breadcrumb item is
represented by a `lightning-breadcrumb` component. Breadcrumbs are actionable
and separated by a greater-than sign.

This component inherits styling from
[breadcrumbs](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/breadcrumbs/)
in the Lightning Design System.

For more information, see [`lightning-breadcrumb`](bundle/lightning-breadcrumb) documentation.
